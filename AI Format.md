	- ### **Key Factions**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Artemins - Faction of information & death
			- motivations: Complete motivation is unknown. Many people surmise there is a deeper meaning or understanding to gathering and having information. The founders of the Artemins used the broken circle to represent a lack of complete understanding.
				- Potential idea: Maybe they are looking for find the meaning to everything and are following this quote: "If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it, because the answer is not separate from the problem."
			- Structure: Leading council with many under-secretaries subfactions and orders.
				- The council should be made up of great leaders in areas. banking, edcuation (sectio) religion, politics but not multiple council members of a similar background.
			- known Subfactions:
				- Information: have informants/spies across the land gathering and collecting information. this is used to recruit and store information. They sometimes act on the information but usually only act on it to further their own motivations or if they are being paid. The most mundane information is collected, stored and cataloged somehow and somewhere but only the catalogers know.
					- For example a single piece of information that may be cataloged could be: financial director of [small town] takes lunch at local bar every thursday and orders ham and tea.
				- Assassinations/death: The Artemins are contracted to carry out assassinations of all levels, farmers killing other farmers from mis-deeds to toppling governments. these Deaths are usually only 1 or two as the artemins set such a high price on lives. The Assassins recieve information from intelligence subfaction to carry out their deeds.
				- Money hoarding: The faction with vast amounts of information at its fingers will make moves at the behest of the council giving it vast amounts of wealth.
		- Illenaeum - Illenaeum is the walls and buildings of the school as well as the school itself. think of it as a college or European boarding school
	- ### **Key Locations**
	  collapsed:: true
		- Nimba- Town where boy killed mother & was born
			- African type town. think jungle type
			- Nimba should be on a land mass away from lesotho to make most of them. Natives are dark skinned and likely sailors.
		- Lesotho - coastal market city, Forming years for Dorcha happen here
		- Giaros - Island of exile and proving grounds
			- small island, around 9 sq miles with 20-ish miles of coastline, mix of mountainous and jungle.
			- Mostly consist of small animals, mice, vermin, fox to big cats such as black panther.
		- Khalshoppe - This is a busling trading city and banking center. small port  but follows a river inland with the more poorer districts further inland.
			- This city started as "Khal's Hope" based off of the fisherman "khal" having a dock and many claimed it was a Kha's Hope that he would catch anything instead of a "fools hope". Khal was not an intelligent person and didn't catch much of anything but he did become wealthy be creating his dock and having high fees to dock there. Over the years the name ran together to become khalshoppe as wealthy men brought their family. the family vacations while the men talked business.
		- Illenaeum (ill-eh-nayum)- Basically a school
		- Garion - walled town where Dorcha kills his father
	- ### **Timeline of Origins**
		- collapsed:: true
		  
		  **The Spark:** Born from a conflict between a Fire Fragment and a Wind Fragment during a wildfire in **Nimba**. The fire killed his "mother," Helen, and aged him magically to age 6.
			- THE BEING created the fragments of creation. These are the pieces of larger beings (Veiled gods) that were tasked to create the planet.
			- These pieces called fragments are separate but wholly focused on fulfilling the goal of their larger beings. This goal changes based on what that veiled god desire but could include:
				- creating elements
				- crafting and building whimsy
				- causing chaos
				- weaving geography
				- Laws of the universe
				- Spreading entropy or stasis
				- Merging life with matter
				- Teaching or sparking desire to learn or do be involved
				- Enforcing order or dominion or even entropy
				- Many more
			- The fragment's goals often conflicted and would cause devastation in different ways.
			- The being and veiled gods are separate from time and not beholden to it. the Fragments are middle level beings that experience no time but at the same all time at the same time. Their entire existence is an instant for them but an eternity for the universe.
			- Some clash or fight in the entirety of the universe's time could cause ramifications across random timelines of the universe and some may have no ramifications at all.
			- Two of these fragments created conflict in no time but at every time at once.
				- One fragment (UN-NAMED) has an innate desire to use fire as tool of recreation.  (somewhat based off of Bennu from Egyption deity)
				- The other Fragment (un-named) is the wind that has a desire to move things from one place to another. this fragment's sole desire is to move specks and spread them. This fragment shows itself as wind but its core desire is to make things move farther from where they start.
			- Most conflicts of these fragments result in very little or nothing and often work together. these same fragments worked together to spread fire in forms of embers starting new fires. wildfires but the conflict of these two created an amalgamation in an unwanted pregnancy.
				- Helen was a woman of a certain use. Known to and by many men. This woman and man conceived a child at a different time but the same place of a past and future wildfire. The man was a nobody. This sexual act resulted in a pregnancy and the specific timing and placement of Helen and this man with the fragment collision caused an abomination. Helen did her normal routines to stop the forming of a child but still a child was formed. The man's sperm resulted in fertilized egg but the vast fragments completely overwhelmed the egg into something wholly unhuman and much stronger.
				- Helen experience vast changes in her pregnancy. some days her womb burned as if from an infection while other times she felt as if she was so light she could fly. helen's pregnancy advanced faster than normal pregnancies. before her full term in one of those instances where she felt herself burning and was greatly disturbed she tried to kill the child again still in her womb but this time with physical violence. The child had already formed to a certain extent in the womb and the fragment beings that occupied the mind at the time understood they were not wanted and fought back in the only way they knew how. They burned Helen and killed her from the inside. in their rage she now only caught fire but the whorehouse they were in caught fire.
				- The tiniest understandings from the fragments understood that this small of a creature would not be able to live on its own and stoked the fire more which caused the child to mature even more rapidly. It was at this time the two conflicting fragments who had been fighting for that moment and eternity ended their fight while time still rippled with the effects of their fight they embedded their essence into this being.
				- Out of the fire, walked a child. not a newborn but a child (aged 6 to human eyes). this child was not seen by the nearby  villagers attempting to put out the fire saw the child leaving the flames and were terrified. They villagers started running away, leaving the surrounded buildings to catch screaming of a demon from below ridding us of these whores.
				- The child fled. Being a fragment of a fragment he had unique abilities. this child appeared human at times but during times of conflict or in reaction to heat or wind would appear to react in different ways. When around a campfire the child;s skin would appear like heated logs and darken further and even glow like an ember. In areas where he was exposed to high winds or an open sky the child would almost appear smoky or as a fog, and almost wisp. (origin of ancestry features)
				- through effort of concentration the child but also fragment of an immortal being could use the fragments of creation to change his form (this is origin of shapeshifter ability).
				- NOTE: the child is born without gender. the fragments themselves being genderless and more of a thing completely overpowered what normal genes and traits the child would have gotten from their parent. I may refer to the child as He or Him because most of the time the child takes a male form. Additionally it may be confused how the child is 6, the ember fragment uses its ability to magically age the child so to provide a way to walk from the fire. This is not a mechanism i plan on visiting again.

		  **The Merchant (Ages 6-10):** Sold to **Kuthier** in Lesotho. Discovered his innate fire/smoke abilities during a warehouse arson.
			- Leaving the cries of the village still in an ember form the child goes to the wilderness. After falling asleep in the woods the child woke up to being manacled in a more human form. Too tired to be worried about putting up a fight the child went with the captors who were slavers.
			- The child would not talk to others but took in their words and language absorbing it.
			- The fragments who imparted their essence did not care much for culture and did not care about the goings on of created mortals so this knowledge was not something they imparted to the child. NOTE: This is why the child seems unable to communicate at first. the fragments did not part this knowledge.
			- Quietly in the night the child would practice speaking to itself learning and repeating words. and experimenting on its body. It knew it was different but did not want to share this. often times when the child was experimenting it would take the form as a fog or smoke and the manacles may be found on the ground the next morning but the child did not leave.
			- The slavers travelled by cargo ship to some mainland. Seemingly in ownership of a deaf dumb and mute child the slavers quickly pawned the child off to a street merchant. The slavers did not know the child was quickly forming an understanding of their world. This worldview matched with what pieces of worldview came from the fragments. People were things just as a tool or animal and could be removed, gotten rid of, sold, killed or other. The ability to control the outcome for others is what was desired.
			- The street merchant further confirmed the boy's worldview. He referred to him as Gilladorcha (sometimes he referred to him as dorcha (door-ha)) and never asked a name. The human merchant named Kuthier sold spices but this was the first time a name or identity was given. The Boy takes the name as his own following this point
			- Kuthier put Gilladorcha in his building and fed him but kept him hidden for a couple days. He was not put to use except moving materials in the merchant's warehouse which the boy did without fuss or words obediently. One night Kuthier pulled him aside.
				- "Dorcha, we are ready for the reason i bought you, I need you to do something for me." Kuthier explained to Gilladorcha his biggest competitor's location and how to get there and to burn it down. Kuthier expected the boy to be caught and killed but since he was mute would not fess up.
				- Armed with only a torch and knife Gilladorcha set off toward the leading spice merchants warehouse which was in a prime location on the docks. along the way several other small street urchins who had never seen Dorcha before started picking on him and eventually led to shoving him. Dorcha set on his task did not react or fight back. the other kids eventually pushed Dorcha into the water putting out his torch. When Dorcha dragged himself out of the water the urchins were gone but he was at his destination with no way to catch the materials inside or the building on fire.
				- Dorcha being frustrated knew his only chance was getting into the building transfigured into a smoke like material and was able to squeeze into a loose sliding door. He was greeted with a dark warehouse that smelled of many spices and scents that were foreign. THere was an office in the corner which a night attendant staid in but Dorcha just assumed a torch was left and was going to use that to catch the building aflame. sneaking to the office and reaching toward the torch he was surprised by the night attendant coming around the corner. They were both surprised at seeing the other and Dorcha was quicker on the reaction. frightened but with fire on his mind the boy took his dagger and stabbed into the man. While the dagger was travelling to the man's leg it ignited in flames. the clothing quickly caught fire and the man caught quickly running towards the door to the docks but stumbling into a powdered spice which ignited immediately catching the shelving on fire.
				- Dorcha seeing his job being accomplished and astonished at how his dagger caught fire,now left the way he came and made it back to Kuthier.
				- Kuthier very surprised to see Dorcha immediately gave him shelter. The next day Kuthier's wares sold out from customers who would normally have visited his competitor.
			- So it was for a number of years that Kuthier sheltered Dorcha as a worker. Dorcha's use of words and willingness to speak grew and every year or so some mishap or problem would occur to a competitor of Kuthier's

			- collapsed:: true
			  
			  **Giaros:** Stranded on an island to learn survival and the "Art of the Hunt."
				- Leaving Kuthier
				  collapsed:: true
					- Around the age of 10 Gilladorcha was able to be free on the streets but he did not look like most of the others in the city so he was still a bit of an outcast. The only time he saw anyone who resembled him they were sailors. His powers of course were not flaunted and Kuthier only understood him to be able to accomplish what was set out as long as it was more physical in nature.
					- The underworld of Lesotho did take notice. A man named Netane who is an informant and intellectual for the Artimens takes notice of Dorcha and notifies them to his presence. they identify a desire to recruit his and spy on luthier
					- The Artemins find that Luthier is skimming from the top on many wholesale deals and providing filler material with what he sells.
					- An Artemins operative who is also a tax assessor for the region slips that he may know who is providing less than bargained for to a large retail shop in the capital. This retailer puts a hit out with some local thugs on Luthier but of course the Artemins know of this.
					- Netane advises Luthier of the hit and that he know someone who can make the concern go away but for a cost. He needs the boy. Luthier balks at this and hires a mercenary group as muscle/bodyguards. a hidden informant at a nearby cafe tells one of the hitmen about one of Luthier's family scheduled events; Luthier's wife and kids go to a hotspring every week. The local thugs use this information to kidnap one of Luthier's children.
					- Now with personal pressure Luthier agrees to sell Gilladorcha to Netane. Luthier's child shows up on the next day at his doorstep and the retail store owner suddenly decides to sell the store retire. Unknown to any in the parties involved the Artemins buy the shop. They use this to gether more information but also launder money.
					- Netane takes Dorcha to the docks immediately where he is whisked on a ship. The captain is transporting some goods unknown to Dorcha. The captains name is Kane. Abord the ship Dorcha is put to work scrubbing the decks daily and tending braziers. Often Kane puts him on some other menial task such as watching the prow of the ship and afterward would question Dorcha about what different crewmembers did during that time. Dorcha quickly learned this was not an exercise in actually what Kane put him to but observations. He learned this by Kane's instruction to draw a picture of the setting sun wrapping around their mast with an island in the distance. While Kane was drawing this with a charcoal pencil he overheard how some of the men were planning to spend some of their keep at the next port. When Dorcha reported to Kane he was asked. "What did you learn?" and upon telling this new information Kane insisted that Dorcha eat in his cabin that night. Other instances where Dorcha did not pay attention Dorcha was met with punishment such as no food, harsher jobs, etc.

					- Kane told the crew the next day they would be harboring near Giaros to wait out any storms for the night. The crew confirmed they were not going ashore because of the beasts that were on the small island. Kane confirmed this. over the night GillaDorcha was on watch, he heard many animal screams and sounds of animals dying and hunting. The island seemed to be home to many beasts even though it was not large. Dorcha did not see any beasts during the night or early dawn.
					- Once preparation were made to set off Kane gave a nod to Dorcha and then another deckhand. The deckhand and some other crewmates grabbed Dorcha and threw him overboard. Dorcha was not able to climb aboard the ship before it went too far away. He swam to the only safety he knew: Giaros (pr: Ji-yuh-rose).
				- Giaros
				  collapsed:: true
					- Dorcha was alone. The island was not large and could be circumnavigated in a day. During the first day Dorcha circled the entire island looking for others or some infrastructure but found none. He also saw only small animal such as mice, rats.
					- Dorcha not used to surviving in this manner and with no preparation slept near the beach. He did not build a fire and could not as he did not have control over his abilities at the time. the first night Dorcha was attacked by an Iberian Lynx (medium sized cat). As he tried to sleep the cat jumped on him and badly wounded his arm before realizing that Dorcha would put up too much of a fight. Dorcha did not sleep the rest of the night  but tended his arm and made plenty of noise to keep other beasts away.
					- THe next day Dorcha built a shelter but still unable to make fire. It was not until the 3rd day that any traps Dorcha had set finally captured a lizard. Dorcha knew the fundamentals of  how fire was made and knew he must use fire to cook his prize. Hours of trying to create fire He injures himself similar to this scene in castaway ({{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUwrfM8aIpA}}). his frustration and anger catches the stick in his hands on fire.
					- Multiple days pass with Dorcha now having fire but having minimal luck and he can feel his strength failing. He sets himself on a nightime hunt or stalk. Dorcha learns the value of the night, concealment. and is able to catch much prey.
					- Dorcha learns a lesson one night during a stalk of a capybara type creature when he becomes the hunted. A black panther pounces on him from a tree. The panther easily overpowers Dorcha and carries him to a tree. Barely holding to life Dorcha's origin of the fog is used the first time as he becomes a fog and travels "very Far" from the black panther to the top of a rocky overhang. Dorcha has learned that you are always being hunted or observed.
					- During his isolation Dorcha also had time to ponder why he was there. Stranding him on this island was incongruous with his life on the ship. He had the feeling that Kane would be back. He was. Mid-Day about a month later the ship peered over the horizon and Kane came ashore personally with a small rowboat.
					- "Well boy, what did you learn?", "This one learned art of hunting, silence, survival and how prey can really be the predator.". "Anything else?" kane asked?. Dorcha looked questioningly at Kane, with a face much older and wiser than what his body showed. "To be truly powerful, one must be nowhere and everywhere". Kane's face held no emotion or betrayed no hint at his thoughts. "come back abord Dorcha" and Dorcha came back on the ship. Once on the ship he was given private quarters and the crew did not bother him and he was not given any tasks.

			  **The Illenaeum:** Academic and martial training in Khalshoppe.
				- 3 days later the ship came to port in the city of Khalshoppe. "Run to the dock and see the harbormaster" Kane told Dorcha. Upon going to the harbormaster expecting to bring him to the ship Dorcha was told he was expected and told to get into a carriage. This carriage carried Dorcha through much of the city and into a walled school called the Illenaeum.
				- A man opened the door for Dorcha and prompted him to follow him. He took him through many passages and made Dorcha thoroughly lost before they entered a plush room with a desk. The man stat at the desk and told Dorcha to sit across.
				- Dorcha learned that he was to be sponsored to attend the school and found he would learn maths, physics, wisdom and athletics. Secretly Dorcha would also learn the ways of stealth, of killing men and ways of becoming an assassin. Dorcha kept silent until prodded and agreed. Dorcha was led to shared quarters and found that he had clothes set aside for him that almost felt tailored to him directly. Dorcha was told to keep a steady mind and be mostly to himself but be congenial when it was proper to do so.
				- Dorcha joined the school and gained an education. He kept to his studies and would sometimes find notes in his books the meet at odd places at odd times of night. These clandestine nightime meetings never follow any schedule and were only with him and a teacher. The teacher taught Many nefarious ways to kill a man and ways to defend himself using physical means. Once Dorcha could could control his body teaching started to include his more mystical talents.
				- Dorcha never questioned his teachings or understood why just he knew he was good at it. He only had one close friend during this time. Lena was not like Dorcha in any way but they did spend free time together. Lena was mischevious often showing Dorcha areas of the school that were hidden to most but already known to Dorcha.
				- One day Lena showed up to classes battered and bruised but Dorcha could not find out how or who did this. Weeks later after a scared look from Lena towards Calx Dorcha knew it was him who gave the bruises.
				- That night Dorcha through man other acquaintances was able to get Calx's roomate to sleep elsewhere. He then  snuck out and got into Calx's room. Dorcha, having stolen some Distilled datura oil from the school pricked Calx's skin with the tip of the datura poisoned blade. This caused him to be aware of his surroundings but not move his body in complete paralysis and putting him in a hallucinogenic state.
				- Dorcha changed his body to that similar of a red Infernis with his skin burning like that of a log. He threatened Calx and told his he saw all and that if Calx hurt anyone else he would certainly die.

				- The next day Dorcha received a message to meet at the willow grove that night. Rae met him tonight. usually it was one of his normal teachers though they never talked about what as done outside of that lesson.
				- "What you did with Calx was.. interesting. We appreciate that you have learned much through us but kindly request your services be used for more purpose. We will get to that. for now you have one more lesson" he handed Dorcha a piece of paper it said. "Kano Faso, Garion" as well as a symbol of a broken circle. the symbol was small and unassuming and could have been mistaken as just a doodle. Dorcha knew what he was being trained for and knew what this meant. He never questioned being trained but everything was coming to a point now. Dorcha's peers were worrying about starting jobs, going into apprentiship or further education. Lena herself was leaving school next semester to become a secretary at a bank.
				- "Why?" was all Dorcha said. "Its a final test", "This body has killed before, You know this". "Yes Dorcha but this is your father". Rae turned and left. Before the words even left Rae's mouth Dorcha knew what they would say, it felt like the words Dorcha had read before in stories.
		- collapsed:: true
		  
		  **The Final Test:** Assassinated his "father," **Kano Faso**, in Garion. Realized the Artemins have a massive information network that "worked for him" during the hunt.
			- Killing his father
			  collapsed:: true
				- Dorcha left that night. He said no goodbyes and was singularly focused. Disturbed and conflicted yes but moving forward. He caught passage onboard a caravan to Garion. Once at Garion he changed shape. the shape was still that of a halfling, Walking through the town the general store caught his eye. the top left corner of the store held a symbol he had seen before. One he was recalling he had seen other times and thought nothing of it but fading paint. A broken circle. Dorcha walked into the store.
				- "Be with you in a minute". The storekeep finished helping the lone customer and turned to Dorcha who waited until they were alone. "One noticed your sign looks like the paint is peeling in an odd manner. The shopkeeper squinted his eyes at Dorcha and pulled him into a backroom. "You must be new. don't you know anything? No names. No mention of the Artemins. only tell me what you need or have to share"
				- Dorcha seemed to have stumbled into information not normally given at this point but he would take the advantage. "I need gold and information on Kano Faso". "Done, I will get you what you need now get out of here"
				- Quite perturbed but ushered out the door Dorcha decided to head to where all information must be shared, the tavern. He had not been before considering his peers were younger but now an older halfling this was no issue. Dorcha grabbed a drink and sat in silence listening for any rumors or for the name. this was something that had not been taught to him. How to find information. Little did he know a network was now working for him. In the village children, beggars, homeless and more were moving information around without being noticed. No one knew why or who needed it. an hour or two later after having a meal and only hearing about how the farming this year is going to be good. Dorcha decided to find a place to sleep. Upon leaving the tavern a boy walked up to him and handed him a piece of paper that had the symbol and said "Under bridge". the boy obviously could not have read the message as he was too young but quickly walked away after giving him the note.
				- Dorcha went to the bridge and looked under it. there he found a pack. inside the pack was a note that said, "better have a cover. traveller works well anywhere" . there was also a small booklet. there was a charcoal drawing of a man's face as well as some information key of which were: "soldier at gate, on duty dawn to dusk 4 days on 1 day off. gambles off day at tannery. usually alone at night. Lives on east wall of town. Known to frequent whorehouses". there was much more information such as where he normally eats and his favorite dishes and recent information about how he is treated as a gate guard.
				- Dorcha was astounded. 2-3 days ago he had heard the name of his father and now within a handful of hours he knows what he looks like, his occupation and normal routine.
				- Dorcha  took the Pack and found a place to stay the night and went through the pack. Inside was some normal travelers items: bedroll, tent, camp utensils and a few bagful's of gold. He had carried money for Luthier but never any that could belong to him. Dorcha  left everything in his room and changed his shape this time to a Simiah. being a bit more nimble in the shadows would be helpful.
				- He spent the evening hiding in the shadows of the village, getting familiar with its nooks and crannys, keeping an eye out for his father. a peek into the place he gambled showed no signs and his housing was dark and Dorcha was not going to  sneak in without more recon.
				- He did watch over the building until shortly before dawn a wrinkling man in his 40s who wore his armor like an old coat walked out. Dorcha did not move but watched his prey. move to out of view and followed behind out of sight. Once at his post Dorcha watched for about an hour before climbing the wall from a side passage and walking through the gate like an unsuspecting citizen.
				- The gate guards including his father barely registered his passing. they were keeping an eye out for wagons or anyone who may cause trouble. Kano Faso was unremarkable in any manner that could eb told from his post.
				- content that the man may be at his post for the next several hours he went to his room to sleep. Upon waking started a week long recon that was more about Gilladorcha wanting to know more about this man that was his father. The information from the booklet was correct down to the finest detail and he continued to take notes in the empty space in the booklet. Noting his dishes eaten, specific schedules, who he talked to and about what.
				- One night Dorcha even shifted shapes to an older Human who posed to be passing through and joined the gambling game. The game tonight was a similar game to blackjack. Dorcha kept his drinks minimal but observed the others. The game was rather simple and Dorcha created rules for himself on when to push and when not to. He left room and when time called for bluffing others he kept his face solemn.
				- the game lasted for a few hours and Dorcha was losing money but slowly. Conversation moved to people's past. Dorcha had taken on Kuthier's name and profession as his own since it was easy to imitate for him. he shared stories overhear from Kuthier and learned of his fathers travels. one of the other players mentioned leaving as his family expected his assistance early the next morning. "Ahh that is why i never whelped any kids myself" Kano said, "not that you know of at least" the host of the game mentioned. Dorcha responded; "i better leave off as well, i should get an early start tomorrow and want to keep my money"
				- Dorcha had noted that night that Kano had a female visitor and felt disgust for this man. He is not his father. He had no father.
				- the next day Dorcha made a show of leaving the town but only went a mile or two where he staged his gear. that night Dorcha took his natural form dark skinned and red hair. He kept his cloak tight and stayed to the shadows. He waited until the moon was high in the sky and used his gale smoke powers to move into the city.
				- Kano was asleep and Dorcha was able to sneak right into his house without him being aware. he stood over him then watching this man, not his father rest. Kano gave no indication that he woke up but suddenly with a normal non-threatening voice said: "Well boy, i've not much to steal as you must've found. the only thing worth anything is my armor and blades. which you can't really sell or pawn without giving yourself away. How about you just walk out of here and I forget this happened?"
				- "I'm not here to steal from you, Your my final test." "Where are you from boy? whats your name?". "I am Gilladorcha, I was found near the village of Nimba"
				- "Odd name, Nimba. yeah i remember that town in the jungle. We were providing some muscle for a nearby..." Dorcha pulled out a knife from his sleeve and Kano noticed the knife.
				- "I see... Some kind of test huh?" Kano's eyes started to dart around to any nearby weapons and Dorcha's hand swept sideways quickly cutting Kano across the chest and one arm. The blood soaked immediately and started spurting from his arm. Kano grabbed at his arm and looked up at Dorcha and his eyes stopped moving.
				- Looking into his father's face Dorcha shapeshifted again, this time into a facsimile of his father. He donned his armor and having studied his gait for days walked to his post. Dorcha knew he manned his post for a couple hours and then and the 9 am bell he and a counterpart on the other side walked around the outside of the city walls. it was during this walk that Dorcha returned to his pack and continued down the path to the next town or village.
			- On the trail the next day he caught up with someone else on the trail. Usually he didn't say anything to anyone he passed. today they called him his full name without him saying anything. "Gilladorcha, walk with me... You did well. You have finished your lessons but there is still more to learn. Go and review an account setup at this bank in your name" he handed Dorcha a card of a bank in Khalshoppe.
			- ON arriving at the bank he was met by a familiar face, Lena stood at the counter. "Dorcha, i was worried about you. you left so abruptly from Illenaeum. Is everything fine?", "Yes , my sponsor required my immediate assistance, But I don't believe I will be back since semesters are over now anyway. I see you found employment?", Lena described how one of her professors shared with Lena an opening at this bank during the final days of school and she took the opportunity.
			- "I would like to deposit some funds and review my account", he deposited one of his two bags of gold and Lena shared with high eyebrows that he had 7 bags of gold in his name and some mail which was handed over. they finished their pleasantries and Dorcha left. The mail was a note from Rae asking to meet when back in town.
			- Dorcha visited Rae. "Dorcha, you have been trained and I think you know somewhat of the organization that has trained you. The Artemins is a network of people who work together. sometimes we gather information, sometimes we kill others often we are stopping mass conflict. Dorcha you are now part of the Artemins. You may be asked to share information, gather information or sometimes kill or even protect. the symbol you have found is our symbol, be observant and you will find it on many places we want to advertise for you to gather. you should never use this symbol yourself on your body but only in messages. The broken circle is a lack of information and everyone's goal is to fill in the circle. If you receive a task or a note with the broken circle your job is to gather information regarding the person or thing in the note and share. if there is a cut across the circle that is a person to be assassinated."
			- "What do the Artemins want?" - "I do not pretend to know everything for many things are kept from me, It seems at times they have wanted money, power, influence, I have seen some acts of kindness as well. I cannot say, What I can say is they protect their own and they pay handsomely".. D:"And whats in it for me?", R:"It seems the artemins connected that you have a fondness for Lena. they set her in her job and offer some protection, in addition to that and being paid for information or *Services* you provide I have been told that there are others like you"
			- Rae shares that Dorcha is likely the child of some unearthly being which cause his abnormality. he does not know how the artemins have this information but this sets forward Gilladorcha's key motivation right now: finding information about what he is. Rae does not know about his formation from the fragments and neither does Dorcha.
			- D:"So what do I do now?", R: "Live life right now, go be different people. The artemins constantly pay for information and your bank here shares accounts across many major cities, The Artemins will invest your money and grow it if you grow their information" Dorcha handed over the notebook of information he gathered on his father and others. he ripped the page of his father's face and kept it to himself.
		- **The Present:** Operating as a freelance agent/informant, hiding in plain sight while hunting for the "Veiled Gods."
			- Leaving the meeting with Rae Dorcha setup housing under an alias and prepaid for a year. saying the housing would be for a student. Dorcha then proceeded to use this as a base for 6-12 months living life as different individuals, shapeshifting to match different persona's, gathering information. Living as a porter for a few months, then some apprenticeship then moving to sailing.
			- Start of campaign
				- Dorcha has the body of a young elvan boy and is working as the assistant to a tailor. He has killed many more and provided information on many.
